    "Assume that you are responsible for counting the number of students who are graduating from Purdue this term based on their responses to a survey. A student who is graduating may submit their response as â€˜Gâ€™ or â€˜gâ€™ and a student who is not graduating could either answer as â€˜Nâ€™ or â€˜nâ€™. These responses are stored in a list called status (as shown below).\n",

Your code should automatically count the results and then calculate a percentage.  This means that if you changed the status string, your code would still work, as expected, for the updated values."
